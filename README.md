# Dracula Theme for Arduino
Dracula theme for Arduino without changing app files.

### Why i made this?
Original Dracula theme for Arduino IDE requires changing files from Arduino installation directory. With this package, you just need to copy this zip package to Arduino themes folder. Original Arduino theme will not change.

### Download
Basically, go to releases and download it.

### Installation for Windows
1) Go to your sketch folder. It's located in your documents folder.
2) Create a folder named `theme` if it isn't exists.
3) Copy `Dracula-1.0.zip` file into theme folder.
4) Open your IDE, go to Preferences and change theme to `Dracula 1.0 (Dracula-1.0.zip)`.
5) Restart your IDE.
